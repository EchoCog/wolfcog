# AtomSpace Mirror

This directory contains mirrored AtomSpace structures and interfaces for the WolfCog AGI system.

## Purpose

- Mirror OpenCog AtomSpace data structures
- Provide local symbolic memory cache
- Enable offline symbolic reasoning
- Bridge between Wolf kernels and AtomSpace

## Structure

```
atomspace-mirror/
├── atoms/          # Cached atom representations
├── relations/      # Relationship mappings  
├── concepts/       # Concept hierarchies
└── schemas/        # Schema definitions
```

## Integration

The AtomSpace mirror enables the WolfCog system to:

- Cache frequently accessed atoms locally
- Perform symbolic reasoning without network dependency
- Maintain consistency with remote AtomSpace
- Optimize memory access patterns

## Usage

The mirror is automatically synchronized with the main OpenCog AtomSpace through the wolf-to-cog-adapter.
