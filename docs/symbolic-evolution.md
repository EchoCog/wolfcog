# Symbolic Evolution

## Overview

WolfCog implements a symbolic evolution system where the AGI can modify its own structure, adapt its behavior, and improve its capabilities through recursive self-modification. This document explains how ecron expressions evolve symbolic memory and task flows.

## Evolution Principles

### 1. Symbolic Substrate

All evolution occurs at the symbolic level:
- **Code as Data**: Programs are symbolic structures that can be manipulated
- **Meta-Circular Evaluation**: The system can reason about its own evaluation process
- **Symbolic Reflection**: Full introspection of symbolic structures
- **Dynamic Recompilation**: Runtime modification of system behavior

### 2. Geometric Memory Evolution

Memory structures evolve as geometric objects:
- **Manifold Topology**: Memory organized as navigable manifolds
- **Differential Geometry**: Evolution follows gradient flows on memory manifolds
- **Topological Invariants**: Preserve essential structure during evolution
- **Metric Learning**: Adapt distance functions in memory space

### 3. Contextual Adaptation

Evolution adapts to execution context:
- **Context Sensitivity**: Different contexts trigger different evolution patterns
- **Temporal Adaptation**: Evolution rate varies with system load and performance
- **Environmental Response**: Adaptation to external stimuli and feedback
- **Goal-Directed Evolution**: Evolution guided by objective functions

## Ecron Expression Evolution

### Expression Syntax

Ecron expressions follow the pattern:
```
"*::{∂Ω(Ψ), ∇μ, ⊗Φ}::*@T⁴::[CFG₁] ⇒ evolve[Ψ]"
```

Where:
- `∂Ω(Ψ)`: Boundary operator on state Ψ
- `∇μ`: Gradient operator with metric μ
- `⊗Φ`: Tensor product with field Φ
- `T⁴`: Four-dimensional time-space manifold
- `CFG₁`: Configuration parameter set
- `evolve[Ψ]`: Evolution operator applied to state

### Evolution Operators

#### 1. Differential Operators
```mathematica
(* Boundary evolution *)
∂Ω[ψ_] := Module[{boundary},
  boundary = FindBoundary[ψ];
  EvolveAlongBoundary[boundary]
]

(* Gradient flow *)
∇μ[ψ_, metric_] := Module[{grad},
  grad = GradientField[ψ, metric];
  FlowAlongGradient[grad]
]
```

#### 2. Tensor Operations
```mathematica
(* Tensor evolution *)
⊗Φ[ψ_, field_] := Module[{tensor},
  tensor = TensorProduct[ψ, field];
  EvolveTensorStructure[tensor]
]
```

#### 3. Temporal Evolution
```mathematica
(* Time-space evolution *)
EvolveInTimeSpace[ψ_, manifold_] := Module[{flow},
  flow = DefineEvolutionFlow[ψ, manifold];
  IntegrateFlow[flow]
]
```

## Memory Evolution Patterns

### 1. Adaptive Restructuring

Memory structures adapt to usage patterns:

```lisp
;; Memory adaptation in WolfCore
(defun adapt-memory-structure (usage-pattern)
  "Restructure memory based on usage patterns"
  (let ((hot-paths (identify-hot-paths usage-pattern))
        (cold-regions (identify-cold-regions usage-pattern)))
    (optimize-hot-paths hot-paths)
    (compress-cold-regions cold-regions)
    (update-memory-topology)))
```

### 2. Symbolic Compression

Frequently used symbolic patterns are compressed:

```scheme
;; Pattern compression in WolfNode
(define (compress-symbolic-patterns patterns)
  "Compress recurring symbolic patterns"
  (let ((frequency-map (analyze-pattern-frequency patterns)))
    (map (lambda (pattern)
           (if (> (pattern-frequency pattern) threshold)
               (create-macro pattern)
               pattern))
         patterns)))
```

### 3. Hierarchical Emergence

Complex behaviors emerge from simple symbolic interactions:

```mathematica
(* Emergence in Ecron *)
EmergentBehavior[components_] := Module[{interactions},
  interactions = AnalyzeInteractions[components];
  emergent = DetectEmergentPatterns[interactions];
  If[Length[emergent] > 0,
    StabilizeEmergence[emergent],
    components
  ]
]
```

## Task Flow Evolution

### 1. Flow Optimization

Task flows evolve to optimize execution:

```mathematica
(* Flow optimization *)
OptimizeTaskFlow[flow_] := Module[{bottlenecks, optimized},
  bottlenecks = IdentifyBottlenecks[flow];
  optimized = Map[OptimizeBottleneck, bottlenecks];
  ReconstructFlow[flow, optimized]
]
```

### 2. Parallel Evolution

Multiple task flows evolve simultaneously:

```lisp
;; Parallel flow evolution
(defun evolve-parallel-flows (flows)
  "Evolve multiple flows in parallel"
  (let ((evolution-contexts (mapcar #'create-evolution-context flows)))
    (parallel-map #'evolve-single-flow evolution-contexts)))
```

### 3. Adaptive Scheduling

The scheduler itself evolves:

```python
# Adaptive scheduling in Python daemons
class EvolvingScheduler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scheduling_strategy = DefaultStrategy()
    
    def evolve_strategy(self, performance_data):
        """Evolve scheduling strategy based on performance"""
        if self.performance_below_threshold(performance_data):
            self.scheduling_strategy = self.mutate_strategy()
        return self.scheduling_strategy
```

## Self-Modification Mechanisms

### 1. Code Generation

The system can generate new code:

```scheme
;; Code generation in WolfNode
(define (generate-new-function spec)
  "Generate function from specification"
  (let ((template (select-template spec))
        (parameters (extract-parameters spec)))
    (instantiate-template template parameters)))
```

### 2. Runtime Patching

Live modification of running code:

```lisp
;; Runtime patching in WolfCore
(defun patch-running-function (function-name new-implementation)
  "Patch a function while it's running"
  (let ((old-function (symbol-function function-name)))
    (setf (symbol-function function-name) new-implementation)
    (register-undo-patch function-name old-function)))
```

### 3. Structural Mutation

Modification of system structure:

```mathematica
(* Structural mutation *)
MutateSystemStructure[system_, mutation_] := Module[{mutated},
  mutated = ApplyMutation[system, mutation];
  If[ValidateStructure[mutated],
    mutated,
    system (* Revert if invalid *)
  ]
]
```

```mathematica
(* Control evolution rate *)
ControlEvolutionRate[rate_, context_] := Module[{adjusted},
  adjusted = AdjustForContext[rate, context];
  If[adjusted > maxRate, maxRate, adjusted]
]
```

### 2. Stability Preservation

```lisp
;; Preserve system stability
(defun preserve-stability (evolution-step)
  "Ensure evolution doesn't destabilize system"
  (let ((stability-metric (measure-stability)))
    (if (< stability-metric stability-threshold)
        (rollback-evolution)
        (apply-evolution-step evolution-step))))
```

### 3. Goal-Directed Evolution

```scheme
;; Goal-directed evolution
(define (evolve-toward-goal goal current-state)
  "Evolve system toward specified goal"
  (let ((distance (goal-distance goal current-state)))
    (if (< distance goal-threshold)
        current-state
        (evolve-toward-goal goal (evolution-step current-state goal)))))
```
