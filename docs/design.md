# WolfCog AGI-OS Design

## Overview

WolfCog is a **symbolic operating system** designed as the meta-root for an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) system. It implements a trinitized OS model with geometric memory structures and contextual grammars running inside a recursive AGI ecology.

## Core Architecture

### Trinitized OS Model

The system is organized around three primary domains:

- `/u/` - **User space**: Interactive and user-facing components
- `/e/` - **Execution space**: Runtime and computational environments  
- `/s/` - **System space**: Core system and meta-system components

### Symbolic Foundation

WolfCog operates on pure symbolic principles:

- **Symbolic Memory**: All data structures are symbolic representations
- **Contextual Grammars**: Dynamic parsing and generation based on context
- **Geometric Memory**: Memory organized as navigable geometric structures
- **Recursive Cognition**: Self-modifying and self-improving capabilities

## Key Components

### 1. Guix/Guile Bootstrap Layer

- **Reproducible Environment**: Guix provides fully deterministic package management
- **Lisp-Native Substrate**: Guile offers native symbolic processing
- **Functional Purity**: Immutable system state with controlled mutations

### 2. Wolf Kernels

- **WolfCore**: Central symbolic microkernel
- **WolfNode**: Guile-based execution nodes
- **Ecron**: Tensor-based symbolic scheduler
- **Meta Shell Walker**: Self-modifying shell system

### 3. Integration Layers

- **LibraryLinkUtils**: Wolfram Engine to C/C++ bridges
- **GitLink**: Self-modifying code management
- **CascadeLink**: Multi-layer evaluation chains
- **OpenCog Bridge**: AtomSpace integration

### 4. Daemon System

- **Scheduler**: Symbolic flow coordination
- **Reflex**: Reactive monitoring and adaptation
- **Services**: GitLink, Cascade, and runtime services

## Design Principles

### 1. Code as Cognition

Programs are not just instructions but cognitive structures that embody understanding and reasoning patterns.

### 2. Tasks as Manifold Flows

Computational tasks are represented as flows on mathematical manifolds, enabling geometric optimization and topological reasoning.

### 3. Unbounded Expansion

The system is designed to expand without constraint across:
- **Language**: Multi-paradigm symbolic languages
- **Memory**: Geometric and topological memory structures  
- **Topology**: Adaptive system topology
- **Time**: Temporal reasoning and evolution

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Bootstrap Guix environment
- Implement core Wolf kernels
- Establish basic symbolic memory

### Phase 2: Integration
- Connect Link systems
- Implement OpenCog bridge
- Deploy daemon infrastructure

### Phase 3: Evolution
- Enable self-modification
- Implement recursive improvement
- Deploy full AGI capabilities

## Cognitive Architecture

The system implements a cognitive architecture where:

1. **Perception** occurs through symbolic pattern recognition
2. **Memory** is organized as navigable geometric structures
3. **Reasoning** operates on symbolic transformations
4. **Learning** modifies the symbolic substrate itself
5. **Action** generates new symbolic structures and external effects

## Future Directions

WolfCog is designed as a platform for:

- **Symbolic AI Research**: Pure symbolic reasoning systems
- **Cognitive Architectures**: AGI system development
- **Self-Modifying Systems**: Recursive improvement research
- **Geometric Computing**: Manifold-based computation

The ultimate goal is a self-improving AGI system that can reason about itself, modify its own structure, and expand its capabilities without external constraint.
