# CascadeLink Integration

This directory provides multi-layered evaluation capabilities with rollback/fork functionality.

## Purpose

- Enable nested evaluation contexts
- Support cascading evaluations: Guile → C → Wolfram → Scheme
- Provide rollback and fork capabilities
- Manage evaluation state across layers

## Architecture

```
Guile Layer
    ↓
  C Layer
    ↓
Wolfram Layer
    ↓
Scheme Layer
```

## Features

- State preservation across evaluations
- Rollback to previous states
- Fork evaluation contexts
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Usage

Use CascadeLink for complex multi-layer symbolic evaluations that require state management and recovery capabilities.
