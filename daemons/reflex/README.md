# Reflex Daemon

Monitors shells and self-modifying symbols for reactive responses.

## Functionality

- Monitor shell activity and state changes
- Detect self-modifying symbolic structures
- Trigger reactive responses to system events
- Implement feedback loops for system adaptation

## Components

- `shell-monitor.py` - Shell activity monitoring
- `symbol-watcher.scm` - Self-modification detection
- `reflex-engine.lisp` - Reactive response system

## Features

- Real-time shell monitoring
- Symbolic structure change detection
- Adaptive response generation
- Integration with scheduler for reactive scheduling

## Integration

Works closely with:
- Meta Shell Walker for shell evolution
- Scheduler daemon for task coordination
- Wolf kernels for symbolic processing
